##  What is QueryClip?

QueryClip is a smart chatbot that can understand and answer questions based on your uploaded videos. It uses:

- A **frontend** (simple user interface) where users ask questions.
- A **backend** that processes questions and talks to a language model (LLM).
- A **vector database** that stores knowledge from your videos.
- A full **pipeline** that extracts text from videos, breaks it into parts (chunks), finds important meanings (embeddings), and helps the chatbot answer using this data.
